WOOPS INSTALLATION STEPS

1 - System requirements
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

WOOPS requires PHP 5.2 or greater. It also requires some PHP components:
    
    - SPL (Standard PHP Library)
    - Reflection
    - SimpleXML
    - Socket connection

Those components are activated by default. If you haven't explicitely disabled
them on your PHP installation, they should be available.

As WOOPS makes an intensive use of the new PHP 5 object model, it also requires
the 'Zend Engine 1 Compatibility Mode' option to be turned off, in the php.ini
file.
If set, this directive changes the behavior of the PHP object model, so it
behaves as in PHP 4, meaning the object won't be passed automatically by
reference. For that reason, WOOPS won't run with this directive turned on.

Please see the 'Install script' section of this file to learn more about the
system requirements.

2 - Filesystem
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The WOOPS sources can be installed anywhere on the hard disk. However, a script
using WOOPS needs some specific directories, in the same directory as it's
located.

The requested directories are:
    
    - cache                 : The directory for the cached items
    - cache/classes         : The cache directory for the PHP classes
    - cache/config          : The cache directory for the configuration files
    - modules               : The WOOPS modules directory
    - resources             : The directory for the resources
    - resources/templates   : The directory for the templates
    - temp                  : The directory for the temporary files
    - uploads               : The directory for the file uploads
    - woops-src             : The directory with the WOOPS sources

Note that the 'woops-src' directory can be a symbolic link. This would allow
you to share the WOOPS sources across multiple websites, for instance.

Also note that WOOPS does not need to be installed on the WWW root of a
virtual host. It can be installed on a sub-folder, or in a user-home directory.

Some directories also need to be writeable by the user running the HTTP server:
    
    - cache/classes
    - cache/config
    - temp
    - uploads

The main WOOPS configuration file also needs to be located at the same level.
That file is called 'config.ini.php'.

Please see the 'Install script' section of this file to learn more about the
filesystem requirements.

3 - Database
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As a framework, WOOPS does not need a database. However, the major features
of WOOPS, like the page engine system or the CMS module will need a database.

Rather than using a particular DBAL system (Database Abstraction Layer), WOOPS
is designed to be virtually compatible with any DBAL system.

Two database engines are available by degault in the WOOPS distribution.
The first one uses PDO (PHP Data Objects), and the other one ADODB.

We recommend using the PDO database engine, as it should be faster, but if PDO
is not available on your PHP installation, or if the driver for your database is
not available, you can use the ADODB one, which does not need anything special
and which supports more databases.

Here are the supported databases in PDO:
    
    - Firebird
    - FreeTDS
    - IBM DB2
    - IBM Informix
    - Interbase 6
    - Microsoft SQL Server
    - MySQL 3.x/4.x/5.x
    - ODBC v3 (IBM DB2, unixODBC and win32 ODBC)
    - Oracle Call Interface
    - PostgreSQL
    - SQLite 3 and SQLite 2
    - Sybase

Here are the supported databases in ADODB (may not be exhaustive):
    
    - Borland version of Interbase 6.5
    - Firebird
    - FrontBase
    - Generic ADO
    - Generic ODBC
    - IBM DB2
    - IBM Informix
    - Interbase 6
    - LDAP
    - Microsoft Access/Jet
    - Microsoft SQL Server
    - Microsoft Visual FoxPro
    - MySQL
    - Netezza
    - Oracle 8/9
    - PostgreSQL
    - SAP DB
    - SQLite
    - Sybase

Please see the 'Install script' section of this file to learn more about the
database requirements.

4 - Install check
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

An install check script is available in the 'scripts/install-check/' directory
of the WOOPS sources.

This script is written in PHP4, and uses no special feature, so it should run
without problem on all boxes.

It checks that the server environment is able to run WOOPS, that the necessary
directory structure is created. It also contains some recommendations about
the PHP configuration.

Please launches this script before using WOOPS, to be sure all the requirements
are met.

When you're done with this script, you should disable it, by adding a call to
the PHP exit() function, as it may reveal important informations about the
server configuration.

5 - Install script
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

WOOPS comes with an install script, located in the 'scripts/install/' directory.

This script will allow you to setup your WOOPS installation, and will create
the necessary database tables, if needed.

This script is disabled by default, for security reason. To enable it, simply
opens the 'scripts/install/index.php' in your favorite text editor, and comments
the line that says 'exit()' (just add a # at the start of the line).

When you're done with the installer, you should disable it again, as an access
to this script would mean a major security hole.

6 - Basic usage
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once WOOPS is properly installed, the only thing you'll have to do is to include
its initialization script, which is called 'init.inc.php', and which is located
at the first level of the WOOPS sources directory.

WOOPS uses the SPL autoload mechanism, so you won't need to include any other
file, as classes and modules are included automatically, when requested.

For instance:

<?php

// Includes the initialization script
require_once( 
    dirname( __FILE__ )
  . DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR
  . 'woops-src'
  . DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR
  . 'init.inc.php'
);

// Starts using WOOPS, and enjoy!
// ...
