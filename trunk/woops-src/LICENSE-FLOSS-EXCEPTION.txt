WOOPS OPEN SOURCE LICENSE EXCEPTION
================================================================================

Version 1.0, January 1st, 2009

Exception intent
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    We want people to be able to build Free/Libre and Open Source Software
("FLOSS") applications using WOOPS despite the fact that not all FLOSS licenses
are compatible with the GNU General Public License (GPL) - version 3.

================================================================================
TERMS AND CONDITIONS
================================================================================

1 - Definitions
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    1.  Terms used, but not defined, herein shall have the meaning provided in
        the GNU General Public License (GPL) - version 3.

    2.  "Library" means WOOPS, for which this exception is applicable.

    3.  "Derivative Work" means derivative works as defined by aplicable
        copyright law.
    
    4.  "GPL" means the GNU General Public License (GPL) - version 3.

2 - Additional grants
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    As a special exception to the terms and conditions of the GPL:

    You are free to distribute a Derivative Work that is formed entirely from
    the Library and one or more works (each, a "FLOSS Work") licensed under one
    or more of the licenses listed below in section 5, as long as:

        1.  you obey the GPL in all respects for the Library and the Derivative
            Work, except for identifiable sections of the Derivative Work which
            are not derived from the Library, and which can reasonably be
            considered independent and separate works in themselves.

        2.  all identifiable sections of the Derivative Work which are not
            derived from the Library, and which can reasonably be considered
            independent and separate works in themselves,

                1.  are distributed subject to one of the FLOSS licenses listed
                    below, and

                2.  the object code or executable form of those sections are
                    accompanied by the complete corresponding machine-readable
                    source code for those sections on the same medium and under
                    the same FLOSS license as the corresponding object code or
                    executable forms of those sections, and

        3.  any works which are aggregated with the Library or with a Derivative
            Work on a volume of a storage or distribution medium in accordance
            with the GPL, can reasonably be considered independent and separate
            works in themselves which are not derivatives of either the Library,
            a Derivative Work or a FLOSS Work.

        4.  the Derivative Work can reasonably be considered independent and
            separate work that is intended for use by end-users and not as a
            library for software development purposes.

3 - Termination
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    If you fail to comply with any of the terms in this Exception then all
rights granted to you herein are void and your rights immediately revert back to
those granted in the GNU General Public License (GPL) - version 3 license.
